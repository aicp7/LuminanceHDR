Here is my first project from git, which is the LuminanceHDR. It's a free open source software. I have used it for two years.
The following is the github website source I copied the code from:
https://github.com/LuminanceHDR/LuminanceHDR.git

The aim of my contribution is to try to add our lab's WDR tone mapping algorithm into this opensource software.
Besides, I hope my idea of how to deal with the wdr image quickly can work.

This file is the readme file. I hope it works.
